## Overview
**Otter Survivor** is a fast-paced, survivor-like game where you take on the role of an adorable yet fierce little otter. Your mission is simple: protect your beloved fish (or "feesh") from an endless wave of enemies who want to steal them. With your quick reflexes, powerful attacks, and the ability to level up, can you keep the feesh safe and survive the onslaught?

## Story
In the world of **Otter Survivor**, you are a small otter with a big heart and an even bigger responsibility—defending your precious feesh. The waters you call home are teeming with hungry foes who will stop at nothing to take what's yours. As their numbers grow, so does the challenge. But you’re no ordinary otter; with each enemy you defeat, you gather clams to power up and become even stronger. How long can you hold out against the relentless tide?

## Gameplay
**Otter Survivor** follows the classic mechanics of the survivor-like genre. Your primary objectives are to:
- **Avoid Enemy Attacks:** Keep moving to dodge the attacks of your enemies.
- **Defend and Attack:** Use a variety of attacks to fend off waves of enemies trying to take your feesh.
- **Collect Clams:** After defeating an enemy, they drop clams, which you must actively collect by moving over them. These clams are essential for leveling up.

The game is a test of skill, strategy, and endurance. How long can you survive?
